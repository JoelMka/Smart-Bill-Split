### Example Scenario üìù

Let's say 5 people went to a restaurant:

- **Person 3**: Fried Rice (‚Çπ150)
- **Person 4**: Chapati (‚Çπ80)
- **Person 5**: Noodles (‚Çπ120)
- **Shared**: Garlic Bread (‚Çπ100) - shared by Person 1, 2, and 3

**Bill Details**:
- Subtotal: ‚Çπ850 (‚Çπ750 individual + ‚Çπ100 shared)
- Tax: ‚Çπ85
- Total: ‚Çπ935

**Fair Split**:
- Person 1: ‚Çπ200 (food) + ‚Çπ33.33 (shared) + ‚Çπ17 (tax) = ‚Çπ250.33
- Person 2: ‚Çπ200 (food) + ‚Çπ33.33 (shared) + ‚Çπ17 (tax) = ‚Çπ250.33
- Person 3: ‚Çπ150 (food) + ‚Çπ33.33 (shared) + ‚Çπ17 (tax) = ‚Çπ200.33
- Person 4: ‚Çπ80 (food) + ‚Çπ17 (tax) = ‚Çπ97
- Person 5: ‚Çπ120 (food) + ‚Çπ17 (tax) = ‚Çπ137

- Each person needs at least one food item to calculate the split

**"Please enter valid bill amounts"**
- Ensure subtotal and tax are positive numbers

**"A person with this name already exists"**
- Use different names for each participant

**"Please select at least 2 people to share this item"**
- Shared items require at least 2 people to be selected

**Shared Items section not appearing**
- You need at least 2 people added before shared items become available
